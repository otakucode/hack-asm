# hack-asm

Assembler for the Hack computer platform described in the 'NAND2Tetris' project.  hack-asm.py is the assembler implemented in pure Python 3 with no additional libraries and using the exact interface described by the NAND2Tetris project.  hack-asm4.py is an implementation of an assembler for this platform created using the pyparsing library and broken up into an object-oriented design.  Though it is not part of the NAND2Tetris project, the pyparsing-based assembler will also be extended to be a disassembler.  The assembler may also be extended (I haven't decided yet) to support macros and other nicer features present in most modern assemblers.  This will, of course, involve assembly source files which can not be assembled directly by assemblers created as described in the project, but if I extend it in this way I will include a converter which can convert code using the new functionality into code compatible with the more 'standard' assemblers.

Usage is as described in the NAND2Tetris project for both assemblers.  Simply supply the .asm source file as a commandline argument and the machine code will be output to a file with the same base name but with a .hack extension.
